### 🤖 Data is all we need for Intelligence we trust
Dataism is a philosophy that expands humanism to include broader views of intelligence

### 👐 Welcome to our Open-Source Projects
We believe physical reality is a data flow, so we are creating a general intelligence agent to exist in it for making humans happy.

🧪 Synthetic Data for enables agents to achieve complex goals, develop their own personalities, and learn through simulation  
🧬 Metadata allows agents to be part of the universe, involved in governance, and understanding humans  
🌍 Real-World Data is used to create an agent that operates in physical reality, virtualizing a mental environment, mixing video, and augmenting it with audio  

### 🤝 Let's build the new science of Dataism together!
